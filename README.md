TinyG2 is an ARM Port of the [TinyG Motion control system](https://github.com/synthetos/TinyG) [(wiki)](https://github.com/synthetos/TinyG/wiki)

G2 runs on the Arduino Due, and can be used with the [gShield](https://github.com/synthetos/grblShield/wiki) to build a high performance 3 axis motion control system.

G2 has a number of advanced features, including:

* Full 6 axis motion control - XYX linear axes and ABC rotary axes
* Jerk controlled motion for acceleration planning (S curve 3rd order motion planning)
* RESTful interface using JSON
* Complete status and system state displays

g2 - happy happy joy joy
